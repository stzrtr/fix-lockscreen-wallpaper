# fix-lockscreen-wallpaper
A simple shell script to fix login wallpaper (displaying the same wallpaper as desktop instead of default). <br>
Tested on macOS Catalina (x86). <br>
<h2>How it works?</h2>
This  script will recreate "Desktop Pictures" in "/Library/Caches" then asking your user account UUID to recreate [UUID] folder in "/Library/Caches/Desktop Pictures", Simple as that. <br>
<h3>Any questions?</h3>
